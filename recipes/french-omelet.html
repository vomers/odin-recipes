        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic breakfast dish is one to bring out in order to impress your in-laws! Technique is essential, so be ready to practice!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 2 pieces</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 large eggs, chilled</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons minced fresh chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Place 2 heatproof plates on rack.</li>
            <li>Cut 1 tablespoon butter in half. Cut remaining 1 tablespoon butter into small pieces, transfer to small bowl, and place in freezer while preparing eggs and skillet, at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for 10 minutes. Crack 2 eggs into medium bowl and separate third egg; add egg yolk to bowl and discard white. Add ⅛ teaspoon salt and pinch pepper. Break egg yolks with fork, then use fork to beat eggs at moderate pace, about 80 strokes, until yolks and whites are well combined. Stir in half of frozen butter cubes.</li>
            <li>When skillet is fully heated, use paper towels to wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet. Melt ½ tablespoon reserved butter in skillet, swirling butter to coat. Add egg mixture and increase heat to medium-high. Use 2 chopsticks or wooden skewers to scramble eggs, using quick circular motion to move around skillet, scraping cooked egg from side of skillet as you go, until eggs are almost cooked but still slightly runny, 45 to 90 seconds. Turn off heat (remove skillet from heat if using electric burner) and smooth eggs into even layer using heat-resistant rubber spatula. Sprinkle omelet with 1 tablespoon Gruyère and 2 teaspoons chives. Cover skillet with tight-fitting lid and let sit for 1 minute for runnier omelet or 2 minutes for firmer omelet.</li>
            <li>Heat skillet over low heat for 20 seconds, uncover, and, using rubber spatula, loosen edges of omelet from skillet. Place folded paper towel onto warmed plate and slide omelet out of skillet onto paper towel so that omelet lies flat on plate and hangs about 1 inch off paper towel. Using paper towel, roll omelet into neat cylinder and set aside. Return skillet to low heat and heat for 2 minutes before repeating instructions for second omelet, starting with step 3.</li>
        </ol>
